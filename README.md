# tbt-score-tracker-test

This is a repo that I'm currently working on containing automated tests for a fishing web application that I'm developing.
The focus of the application is to serve as a live updating scorebaord for fishermen in small fishing competitions. The fishermen will log
their catches in the app and the live leader board will update for all participants.

These tests were developed using Robot Framework, the best functional testing tool for automation available today!

More to come as the app grows.
